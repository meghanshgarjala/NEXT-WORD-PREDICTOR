# Next Word Predictor

This project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts the next word in a sequence based on randomly selected text data from the internet. The goal is to generate a text completion tool that can be integrated into various applications, such as chatbots, writing assistants, or educational tools.

## Project Overview

The Next Word Predictor leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze a given sequence of text and suggest the most likely next word. The model is trained on diverse datasets obtained from internet sources, allowing it to understand a wide range of language patterns and contexts.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Provides word suggestions based on the preceding text input.
- **Contextual Understanding:** Learns from large datasets to understand the context in which words are used.
- **Adaptable:** Can be trained and fine-tuned on different datasets to cater to specific domains or applications.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Text data is randomly collected from various internet sources. The data is preprocessed to clean and standardize the text.
2. **Model Training:** The cleaned text is used to train a machine learning model. Models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, or Transformer architectures (e.g., GPT) may be used to predict the next word in a sequence.
3. **Prediction:** Once trained, the model takes a text input and predicts the most likely next word based on the patterns it has learned.
4. **Fine-Tuning (Optional):** The model can be fine-tuned to improve accuracy on specific types of text or applications.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for experimentation)
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (depending on the model used)
  - `nltk` or `spaCy` for text preprocessing

## Installation
